# CS188-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository contains all the project work from CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, taken at UC Berkeley in Spring 2018. Topics include search, game playing, knowledge representation, inference, planning, reasoning under uncertainty, machine learning, robotics, perception, and language understanding.

Any duplication, reproduction or copying any part of the code and/or the entire code (including UC Berkeley students taking the course) without my permission is strictly against UC Berkeley code of conduct (for UC Berkeley students), and can and will count as plagiarism (for everyone). I hold no responsibility should a student be caught plagiarising and/or using my code as reference, as the code is made public solely for my professional growth.
